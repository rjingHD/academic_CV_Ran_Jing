\item Built a fast, high precision, fully implicit soft elastic rod simulator (in C++) that supports soft physics, frictional contact, and control inputs. 
\item Implemented a natural curvature controller to achieve soft robot motion control in simulation, which could be potentially used as a reinforcement learning training gym environment.
\item Created a generalizable gradient-descent approach for "real2sim‚Äù mapping of actual soft manipulators in simulation.
