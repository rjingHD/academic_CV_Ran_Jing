\begin{rSubsection}{MED Fusion Lab - 3-D Object Reconstruction with Franka Robot Arm}{WPI}{Student Reseacrcher. Advisor: Prof. Haichong (Kai) Zhang}{Sept. 2019 -- Dec. 2019}
\item Used an Oculus VR headset to control the motions of a Franka Emika Panda robot arm in Gazebo simulator.
\item Implemented a robot tip position controller and tested robot motion planning with a physical Franka robot arm.
\item Utilized an intel RealSense depth camera with the robot arm for object 3D reconstruction using both visual odometry and camera poses derived from Franka's forward kinematics.
