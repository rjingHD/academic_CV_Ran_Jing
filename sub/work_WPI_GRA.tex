% \item Built a scenario tree data structure for efficient disturbance sequences representation in control problems.
% \item Designed and built a clustering-based approximation for disturbance sequences to find optimal control policy via dynamic programming with significantly reduced computational load (10 times faster).
% \item Tested the proposed method on a hybrid electric vehicle battery management system in simulation.
