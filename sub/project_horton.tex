\begin{rSubsection}{SRC Lab -  Safe Balancing Control of a Soft Legged Robot.}{Boston University}{Graduate Research Assistant. Advisor: Prof. Andrew P. Sabelhaus}{May 2022 -- Nov. 2022}
\item Designed a 5-limbs soft legged robot platform, Horton, with thermal shape memory alloy (SMA) wire muscles and sensors for its position and the actuator temperatures.
\item Proposed a feedback control system with safety guarantees on some aspects of its operation and human interaction.
\item Achieved repeatable soft legged robot balancing under human interference while maintaining robot state safety.
